## Yo!

Your boss is a dick! He wants you to store a drum of radioactive waste at the very bottom of the power plant.

Everybody knows this basement is dangerous, they build it on unstable ground and they save money on building material.
This place is a mess its falling appart and it's running out of place to store the drums.
Not to mention the countless stories about workers that never came back.

Well… [down we go](https://eptwalabha.com/ld42/)!

Each basement is equipped with a Geiger counter that will seal the door shut if it detects any radioactive life.  
Clear the room from any creature to go to the next basement.  
Don't worry about the creatures, they move only if you move.  
Mind where you're walking, the floor breaks easily.
